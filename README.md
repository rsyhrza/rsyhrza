<h1 style="text-align: center;">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Robensyah Irza Maulana!</h1>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">A passionate programmer with a deep love for coding since childhood.</h3>

## Evolution of Skills
I started my programming journey independently, exploring PAWN language at a young age, which sparked my fascination with coding and problem-solving. Transitioning to C#, I began creating UI applications with Windows Forms. Progressing into C++, I started going into more complex programming, particularly focusing on projects involving process memory manipulation.

Alongside mastering C++, I expanded my skills to include Lua, Python, and JavaScript, leveraging their versatility in various projects. My curiosity on how these programming languages work led me into the world of reverse engineering, where I explored the inner workings of operating systems and honed my skills in IDA (Interactive Disassembler) for deep system analysis.
